# MolSSI
Sample codes for MolSSI application

He_HF.f90 --> Hartree-Fock code for the energy calculation of Helium ground state.

dvr.f90 --> Discrete Variable Representation based on Colbert and Miller's paper for the calculation of eigenfunctions for a given potential.

findirc.f90 --> This code retrieves the xyz coordinates of geometries along the IRC from a Gaussian09 IRC calculation.

abs_spec-new.f90 --> Generates the absorption spectra from a set of energies and oscillator strengths. This code is a part of our in-house lab code called SArCASM (Simulating Absorption Spectra for Complex And Solvated Molecules).

stab_analysis_555.m --> Code for performing (5,5,5) Generalized Pade approximants analytic continuation. Used in the determination of complex energies for electronic resonances from stabilization calculations.
